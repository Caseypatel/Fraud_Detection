# Fraud Detection System for E-Commerce Transactions

## Project Overview and Use Case:

### Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based fraud detection system that can identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, thereby reducing financial losses and improving the overall security of e-commerce transactions.

### Background:

E-commerce has become an integral part of modern retail, with millions of transactions taking place every day. However, this growth has also led to an increase in fraudulent activities, resulting in significant financial losses for businesses and individuals alike. Traditional rule-based systems are no longer effective in detecting fraud, as fraudsters have become more sophisticated in their methods.

### Problem Statement:

The e-commerce company, "OnlineMart," is facing a significant challenge in detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions. The company's current system relies on manual reviews and rule-based checks, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. As a result, OnlineMart is experiencing a high rate of false positives, leading to unnecessary transaction cancellations and revenue losses.

## Project Evaluation
### Final Model Accuracy:

98% for predicting fraud detection
### Final Model Recall:

86% of the time the model will correctly predict fraudulent transactions.
