# Fraud Detection System for E-Commerce Transactions

## Project Overview and Use Case:

### Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based fraud detection system that can identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, thereby reducing financial losses and improving the overall security of e-commerce transactions.

### Background:

E-commerce has become an integral part of modern retail, with millions of transactions taking place every day. However, this growth has also led to an increase in fraudulent activities, resulting in significant financial losses for businesses and individuals alike. Traditional rule-based systems are no longer effective in detecting fraud, as fraudsters have become more sophisticated in their methods.
